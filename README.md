# Game Price Scraper README

This script allows you to compare game prices across different online stores including Steam, Microsoft Store, and GOG. The script uses Selenium, a web automation framework, to navigate through the websites and extract game price information. The extracted data will help you quickly compare prices and make informed purchasing decisions.

## Introduction

This script demonstrates how to use Selenium for web scraping. It navigates through the Steam, Microsoft Store, and GOG websites to find the price of a game based on user input. By executing this script, you can conveniently compare prices across these platforms.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed. If not, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and operating system (Edge in this case) from Microsoft Edge WebDriver.

## Usage

1. Open the game_price_scraper.py file in a code editor.
2. Modify the "Pesquina" variable with the game title you want to search for.
3. Set up the WebDriver's path in the browser = wd.Edge() line. Provide the path to the downloaded Edge WebDriver.
4. Run the script:
   python game_price_scraper.py
5. The script will navigate through the websites, extract game prices, and display the results.

## Supported Stores
  The script currently supports the following online stores:
    - Steam
    - Microsoft Store
    - GOG
    - Playstation Store
  IÂ´ll be adding more online stores soon!!
